<h1>The best movies according to Joyboy.</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pulp fiction</h3>
<p>I enjoy the classic situational comedy in this movie.</p>
<h3>Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>I love how they mixed the comical art with animation that has an interesting plot with multiverse concept.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>
A well crafted movie with top notch visuals and background score.<br />
One of the finest works of Christopher Nolan.
